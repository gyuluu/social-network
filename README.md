# The Creators Network

The Creators Network is a single page application that has a similar functionality to a social network. Users can register, login, add or remove friends, chat in real time or write on each other's walls. The project was completed during my time at Spiced Academy and it was built using React.js, Redux and Socket.io. It features both class and function components.
